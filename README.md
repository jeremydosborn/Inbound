Inbound is a small Rust library for monitoring network traffic and flagging scan-like behavior. It watches for common patterns and creates events you can log or forward elsewhere.

This is my first Rust project and it’s still experimental. Right now it’s best suited for LAN / gateway monitoring and for learning or prototyping. Expect rough edges and breaking changes while I iterate.
